#FROM PYDIS:
# any number that is divisible by 7, is also divisible by 3*7 (or smaller than 3*7) seeing as how you don't care what the number is, 
# if your tests are "is it a multiple of 7" you can also take the mod of that, number % 21, 
# first and it'll still have the same result for "is it a multiple of 7"
